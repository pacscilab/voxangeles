VoxAngeles Corpus: Phonetic Segmentation of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive

VoxAngeles is a corpus of audited phonetic transcriptions and phone-level alignments of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive (Ladefoged et al., 2009, http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/), along with phonetic measurements including word and phone durations, vowel f0 and vowel formants. The corpus currently contains data from 95 languages across 21 language families. 

The audited and aligned data (**audited_aligned**) contain manually corrected phone-level alignments and audited phonetic transcriptions for the word-level segmentations provided in the CMU Release of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive (Li et al., 2021, https://github.com/xinjli/ucla-phonetic-corpus). The unaudited and aligned data (**unaudited_aligned**) contain force-aligned phone-level alignments and original phonetic transcriptions directly from the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive. The corpus is free to use under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license. 

The corresponding paper is currently under review. Please contact us for more details.
